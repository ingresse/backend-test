# Ingresse Backend Devloper test

## Proposal

We are creating a new version of Event management and we want to start with an event search tool in order to let our customer find the event that they want and tell everyone they are going to attend to this event.

This project is focused on the creation of an REST API for events information.

## What is an Event

For this exercise, an event is consisted of:

- Name
- Sessions (list)
    - Date and time
- Place    
- Tags (list)
- Interested

## Create a REST API Using HTTP Verbs for a /events Endpoint

The application just need the basic endpoints for manage the content (create/update/delete).

Also, we must have a search endpoint to search those events. There must be a way to filter by all data from event.

Once the customer finds the event, they can add an interest to it, so other customers can see how many people are interested in these event. 

### Requirements:

- The decision if wich technologies to be used is entirelly yours. You can pick the ones that make you confortable to show us your skills. But keep it in mind: Chosing an fully built solution can make difficult for us to now how you work and how you code. 

- We want to see how you test your code, specially how you do unit tests.

- We expect a clear documentation of how to setup, run and test your project (README.md).

### We Recommend:

- Use Docker for the project's infrastructure.

- It's always good to see integrations with tools that show the quality of the project. For quality we mean test coverage, complexity, maintainability, etc.

### What we expect

We just expect a Git repo (on Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc.). 

The Ingresse team will try to analyse many aspects of your work. We will basically see if:

- you understanded the entire scope and gave an acceptable solution; 
- you choose tools that fit well to the problem
- your code is clear and simple enought;
- the repo is well maintained, with a good and clear commit tree;
- your tests are covering well the application scenarios.

We are also interested in how you work. Here in Ingresse we want to change the way people think in real experiences in their lives and this is only achieved with a creative, inovative and user-focused culture. We also believe that the most valuable part of our job is to make that with simplicity and elegance. Keep that in mind while solving this test :). 

### Feedback

We are just happy that you are doing this test! Feel free to tell your experience and how we could improve our process.
